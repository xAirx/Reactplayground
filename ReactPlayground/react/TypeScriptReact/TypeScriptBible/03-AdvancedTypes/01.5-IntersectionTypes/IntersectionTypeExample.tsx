/* Intersection Types (Multiple values into one)

An intersection type is a way of combining multiple types into one. Meaning that you can merge a given type A with a type B or more and get back a single type with all properties.

/* Intersection Types

Intersection types are closely related to union types, but they are used very differently.

An intersection type combines multiple types into one.

This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.

For example, Person & Serializable & Loggable is a type which is all of Person and Serializable and Loggable. That means an object of this type will have all members of all three types.

For example, if you had networking requests with consistent error handling then you could separate out the error handling into itâ€™s own type which is merged with types which correspond to a single response type.
