/* The type can also be passed in to < T >, as below â€“ but this isn't necessary most of the time, as TypeScript will infer it. */

/* Generics allow you to have type - safety in components where the arguments and return types are unknown ahead of time.

  In TypeScript, generics are used when we want to describe a correspondence between two values.

  In the above example, the return type was related to the input type.We used a generic to describe the correspondence.
