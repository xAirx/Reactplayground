Both types and interfaces are almost the same, and their fundamental differences are not that relevant for the super-simplistic case of React component props.
Use whichever one you feel comfortable with unless there's a specific valid reason to use one over the other, like in the examples I laid out above.
The only thing I ask of you is that you don't mislead others into thinking that "you should always use types for React props" or
React props should always be declared with interfaces" and that one or the other is a "best practice" or "anti-pattern".
