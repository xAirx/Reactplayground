/* TypeScript - Type Aliases


TypeScript allows to create reuseable aliases for a simple, intersection, unions, tuples or any other valid TypeScript types.

To declare an alias we need to use the following syntax:

type myTypeName = <a valid TypeScript type>



Type can be of three types:

 1. Any type: – By using any data type, it means type checking for a variable cannot be done.

 2. Built-in type: – the data types which are already there in a system like a number, string, boolean, void, null and undefined.

 Null means that the variable has been set to an object whose value is undefined. Undefined means that the variable has no value or object assigned to it.

3. User-defined data types: – the data types which are declared by the user like enums, classes, arrays, etc. */
