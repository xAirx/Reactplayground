Consider implementing Code Push for faster feedback loop from developer to the testers and clients
As the project timeline comes to an end, communication and feedback loop between testers/client and developer must be the fastest possible. You will probably come to a situation where you made a test release of the app with some small bug that breaks the app and the testing can not continue. And the fix for the bug is very simple, one or two lines of JS code. In order to deliver that fixed version you need to increase build numbers, create a new release, and upload it to the TestFlight or Google Play store testing track, which we all can agree is at least 1 hour of work. To make the feedback loop shorter you can use Code push. Code Push is a cloud service from Microsoft Visual Studio App Center, that acts as a central repository where developers can publish certain updates. These updates are then queried by apps using the client Code Push SDK. Since Code Push is in semi-violation of the Google and Apple store guidelines, I won’t encourage you to implement it in the production version of the app, but for test and development purpose you can find it very helpful. I’ve covered Code Push in the Implementing Code Push in React Native applications article. In the article you can find more information on what Code Push is and how to implement it.
