I have gone through this confusion what is the difference between the array operations concat() and spread(...) operator.

Both are doing the same function of adding elements to the array.

I searched the internet and came with the ideas and loved to share with the world.

    'concat()' will add the elements at the end of the array while spread operator
    can be used to add elements at any part of the array.

    While appending string to an array using spread operator has to be cautious as
    spread literally spread the string to letters and add it to the array. Concat() will add the string as a single word.

    When working with large arrays, spread will go out of memory and may
    throw error while concat can handle comparatively larger arrays.

    Spread operator will get the value from a generator function while concat() will
    push the generator return to the array. This shows that the spread operator will
    iterate through the items and append the value to the array.

    Spread operator is efficient when used with single paramater as it iterates
    through the item check its type to split and insert in to the array.
    While concat() can used for multiple parameters that is to be inserted in
    to the array when directly append the given elements to the array.

To state, it depends upon the problem which we solve decides what to use and how to use.
There are many other differences also, but these that got my attention to write a blog. Thanks.
