/*
You have to use setState

The reason it can be confusing: if you change the parent's state by hand (bad practice!), the object will change in the child component, too.

But won't trigger re-render! (The child component won't "know" that its props has changed.) So you won't see the UI change.

However if you change the parent's state with setState (the preferred practice), the child will be notified, that it must re-render itself.
