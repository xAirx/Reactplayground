The new state count holds the number of bulbs, and is initialized with 1: */

  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1);
  const lightSwitch = () => setOn((on) => !on);
  const addBulbs = () => setCount((count) => count + 1);
  const bulb = <div className={on ? "bulb-on" : "bulb-off"} />;

/* Open the demo, then click Add bulb button: the number of bulbs increases. Clicking On/off button switches on/off the bulbs.

React app multiple state

    [on, setOn] = useState(false) manages the on/off state
    [count, setCount] = useState(1) manages the number of bulbs.

Multiple states work correctly within one component. */
