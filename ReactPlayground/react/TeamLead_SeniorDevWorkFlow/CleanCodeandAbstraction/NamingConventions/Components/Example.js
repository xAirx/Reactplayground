The meaning behind naming conventions is to easily recognize what type of element you're dealing with and to have something in your code that is common in the community.

Name your file the same as the React component inside that file For example:
❌announcement - bar.jsx

✔️AnnouncementBar.jsx

Use well - descriptive names for your variables so that even a third party or new developer can easily understand you code.

❌
const message = 'Good afternoon, Mr. Jhon';
const wm = 'Good afternoon, Mr. Jhon';
const m = 'Good afternoon, Mr. Jhon';

✔️
const welcomeMessage = 'Good afternoon, Mr. Jhon';
