/* Styled components are modern and easy to use
and it allows you to take advantage of all the
features of plain CSS as well.

In my opinion, it is easier to use and more
powerful than MaterialUI(you can also style MaterialUI
    components with this, instead of using makeStyles).
    It's also better than importing a CSS file since it
    is scoped and styled components are reusable. */
